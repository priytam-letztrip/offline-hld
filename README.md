# Flutter Offline-First Architecture Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for implementing a Flutter offline-first application using BLoC, Hive, and a dedicated Sync Engine.

## 📚 Documentation Overview

This repository provides two complementary documentation files that together form a complete guide for building production-ready offline-first Flutter applications:

### 1. [Overview & Technical Specifications](overview.md)
**High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD)**

- **HLD (High Level Design)** — Components, responsibilities, end-to-end flow, non-functional requirements
- **LLD (Low Level Design)** — Data schemas, box layout, queue item schema, sync algorithm, retry/backoff, conflict resolution pseudo-logic, APIs between layers
- **Implementation Details** — Concrete folder structure, recommended packages, key code snippets, testing & observability, edge cases and migration notes

### 2. [Complete Architecture Guide](Flutter_Offline_First_Architecture.md)
**Comprehensive Implementation Guide with BLoC**

- **Technology Stack** — Complete breakdown with BLoC as state management
- **System Components** — All layers and their responsibilities
- **Data Flow Diagrams** — Visual representations of offline/online flows
- **BLoC Implementation** — Complete state management setup with events, states, and handlers
- **Conflict Resolution** — Multiple strategies and implementations
- **Code Examples** — Real implementation code for all components
- **Best Practices** — Production-ready guidelines

## 🎯 Quick Start

### For High-Level Understanding
Start with [overview.md](overview.md) to understand:
- System architecture and component responsibilities
- Data flow and sync mechanisms
- Non-functional requirements and constraints
- Technical specifications and design decisions

### For Implementation
Use [Flutter_Offline_First_Architecture.md](Flutter_Offline_First_Architecture.md) to:
- Set up your Flutter project structure
- Implement BLoC state management
- Configure Hive local storage
- Build the sync engine and conflict resolution
- Follow best practices for production deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Core Components
- **BLoC State Management** - Reactive state management with events and states
- **Hive Local Storage** - Fast, offline-first data persistence
- **Sync Engine** - Reliable background synchronization
- **Conflict Resolution** - Multiple strategies for handling data conflicts
- **Connectivity Management** - Smart network state handling

### Key Features
- ✅ **Offline-First** - App functions fully offline
- ✅ **Eventual Consistency** - Data syncs when network available
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution** - Multiple strategies supported
- ✅ **Fault Tolerance** - Graceful error handling and retries
- ✅ **Production Ready** - Comprehensive testing and monitoring

## 📊 Visual Documentation

The repository includes comprehensive diagrams:
- **Data Flow Diagrams** - Offline and online data flows
- **Sequence Diagrams** - Step-by-step interaction flows
- **End-to-End Diagrams** - Complete system workflows
- **Architecture Diagrams** - Component relationships and layers

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the Overview** - Start with [overview.md](overview.md) for architectural understanding
2. **Follow Implementation Guide** - Use [Flutter_Offline_First_Architecture.md](Flutter_Offline_First_Architecture.md) for step-by-step implementation
3. **Review Code Examples** - Copy and adapt the provided code snippets
4. **Apply Best Practices** - Follow the production-ready guidelines
